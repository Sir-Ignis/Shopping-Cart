# Shopping Cart

This is a Vanilla JS implementation of a Shopping Cart. Currently, there are two implementations one using flex boxes and one which uses grids. Cookies are used to store item data and requests are sent and received using JSON in the flex box implementation. localStorage is used to store item data in the grid implementation.
